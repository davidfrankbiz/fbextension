                    <p class="facebook-containt">We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect against unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction of PII.</p>
                    <p class="facebook-containt">However, no method of transmission over the internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect PII, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>
                    <p class="facebook-containt">- We strive to maintain the reliability, accuracy, completeness and currency of PII that we collect and to protect the privacy and security of our users.

                    <p class="facebook-containt">- We limit access to PII about you to employees, contractors and agents who we believe reasonably need to come into contact with that PII. These individuals are bound by confidentiality obligations and may be subject to discipline, including termination and criminal prosecution, if they fail to meet these obligations.</p>
                    <p class="facebook-containt">- We have physical, electronic, and procedural security measures and safeguards to reasonably protect PII. Our servers and our databases are protected by industry standard security technology, such as industry standard firewalls and password protection.</p>

                    <p class="facebook-containt">The Company processes PII only for the purposes for which it was collected and in accordance with this Privacy Policy or any applicable service agreements to which the user has consented. We review our data collection, storage and processing practices to ensure that we only collect, store and process the PII needed to provide or improve our Services. We take reasonable steps to ensure that the PII we process is accurate, complete, and current, but we depend on our users to update or correct their PII whenever necessary. Nothing in this policy is interpreted as an obligation to store information, and we may, at our own discretion, delete or avoid from recording and storing any and all information.</p>

                    <p class="facebook-containt">- Upon receipt of your written request and enough information to permit us to identify your PII, we will disclose to you the PII we hold about you. Upon your request, we will also correct, amend or delete any PII that is inaccurate and notify any third party who received this PII from us of the necessary changes.</p>

                    <p class="facebook-containt">- We do not charge for complying with a correction request, however, for all other requests, we may charge a small fee to cover its costs unless prohibited by applicable law. Requests to delete PII are subject to any applicable legal and ethical reporting or document retention obligations imposed on the Company.</p>

                    <p class="facebook-containt">- We ask individual users to identify themselves and the PII requested to be accessed, corrected or removed before processing such requests, and we may decline to process requests that are unreasonably repetitive or systematic, require disproportionate technical effort, jeopardize the privacy of others, or would be extremely impractical, or for which access is not otherwise required.</p>

                    <p class="facebook-containt">Since your PII will be instantly anonymized we may, however, not always be able to provide the foregoing, including without limitation disclosing it to you, correcting, amending, deleting it and/or notify third parties of the changes.</p>

Please feel free to direct any questions or concerns regarding this Privacy Policy or our treatment of PII by contacting us as provided above. When we receive formal written complaints it is the Company's policy to contact the complaining user regarding his or her concerns.
